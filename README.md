Lab 1: Introduction to Machine Learning



Welcome to Lab 1 of the Fall AI Studio! This lab introduces core machine learning concepts and workflows using a variety of real-world datasets across domains like hospitality, housing, dining, zoology, and transportation.

Datasets Used



| Dataset | Description |

|--------|-------------|

| \*\*Airbnb Listings NYC (Dec 2021)\*\* | Modified dataset of NYC Airbnb listings (price, location, reviews, etc.) |

| \*\*Housing Prices\*\* | Contains home attributes and sale prices for regression analysis |

| \*\*Restaurant Business Rankings 2020\*\* | Ranked list of top restaurants with metadata for clustering/classification |

| \*\*Zoo Animal Classification\*\* | Categorical data for supervised learning practice |

| \*\*Flight Delay Data\*\* | Delay and schedule info from airlines to practice time-based or binary classification |

Objectives



\- Understand and apply foundational machine learning concepts

\- Explore and preprocess real-world datasets

\- Perform basic classification, regression, and clustering tasks

\- Build comfort with Jupyter/Colab workflows

\- Identify modeling potential in messy and varied data types



---



Methodology



Across these datasets, youâ€™ll practice:



\- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

\- Data cleaning and transformation

\- Label encoding and feature scaling

\- Simple ML modeling (e.g., linear regression, k-NN, decision trees)

\- Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, MAE/RMSE)



Each dataset is explored through individual exercises and example notebooks.
